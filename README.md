## Project Summary
This project implements a simple AI pipeline for classifying short English sentences into **positive** or **negative** sentiment.  
I compared a **naïve keyword-based baseline** with a **pretrained transformer model** (`distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`) and evaluate their performance on a small dataset of 40 sentences.

## Methods Used
### 1. Naïve Baseline  
A simple keyword rule-based classifier.  
It works on explicit words but fails on subtle context or negation.

### 2. AI Pipeline  
A HuggingFace sentiment-analysis pipeline using DistilBERT.  
It handles context, negation, and more natural phrasing.

## Results
| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Baseline | **0.80** |
| DistilBERT Pipeline | **1.00** |

The AI model correctly identifies subtle emotional tone and handles edge cases where the baseline fails.
